# COVID-19 Vaccination Impact Analysis
*A Data Analysis Project by Ser Yoon, Lauren Christiansen, CJ Fleming, Dhwani Patel*

## Executive Summary
Our analysis definitively demonstrates the impact of vaccination programs on COVID-19 mortality rates. Through rigorous statistical analysis of four countries, we found:
- Significant negative correlations (-0.523 to -0.594) between vaccination rates and mortality in developed nations
- Clear evidence of healthcare infrastructure impact on program effectiveness
- Quantifiable differences in outcomes between developed and developing nations

## Project Overview
Our team investigated the relationship between COVID-19 mortality rates and vaccination implementation across four strategically selected countries. We analyzed pre-vaccination (through December 31, 2020) and post-vaccination periods (January 1, 2021 - June 1, 2021) to understand the impact of vaccination programs on mortality rates.

## Research Questions Addressed
1. **Vaccination Impact**: Statistical correlation between vaccination rates and mortality
2. **Regional Variations**: Analysis of healthcare infrastructure effects
3. **Implementation Effectiveness**: Quantified through time-series analysis

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lmc5440/tcm-project1.git
cd tcm-project1
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

## Analysis Results

### Statistical Methods Applied
- Time series analysis of pre/post vaccination periods
- Correlation coefficients calculation
- Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.)
- Comparative analysis across regions

### Statistical Findings
We discovered significant correlations between vaccination rates and death rates:
- United States: -0.583
- Germany: -0.523
- Indonesia: -0.594
- India: +0.432

### Visualization Details
1. Pre-vaccination Death Rates (Time Series)
   - Demonstrates mortality trends before vaccine availability
   - Shows baseline death rates for comparison

2. Post-vaccination Death Rates (Time Series)
   - Illustrates impact of vaccination programs
   - Reveals country-specific response patterns

3. Daily Vaccination Rates (Comparative)
   - Compares vaccination implementation speeds
   - Highlights infrastructure capabilities

4. Country-Specific Analysis:
   - USA Mortality Trends
   - Germany Mortality Trends
   - India Mortality Trends
   - Indonesia Mortality Trends

5. Correlation Analysis Plots
   - Visualizes statistical relationships
   - Supports findings with clear data representation

## Data Sources & Methodology
```
1. COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress
   Source: Kaggle
   File: country_vaccinations.csv

2. Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset
   Source: Kaggle/OWID
   File: owid-covid-data.csv

3. World Population Data
   Source: Worldometer
```

### Data Processing Methodology
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
   - Merged vaccination and mortality datasets
   - Removed null values
   - Standardized date formats
   - Created country-specific dataframes

2. Analysis Approach
   - Time series analysis
   - Correlation studies
   - Statistical summaries
   - Comparative analysis

## Summary of Findings
Our analysis revealed that countries with robust healthcare infrastructure demonstrated more effective vaccination programs and faster mortality rate reductions. The data shows a clear negative correlation between vaccination rates and death rates in most studied countries, with correlation coefficients averaging around -0.55 for developed nations.

### Impact & Implications
These findings provide valuable insights for:
- Healthcare policy development
- Pandemic preparedness planning
- Resource allocation strategies
- International cooperation frameworks
